# Recipe App

## Introduction

The **Recipe App** is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart that allows users to browse, search, and save a variety of recipes. Users can explore different cuisines, dietary preferences, and meal types, and save their favorite recipes for easy access.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for finding and managing recipes.

## Features

- **Recipe Search and Filtering:** Search recipes by ingredients, cuisine, dietary preferences, and meal types.
- **Recipe Details:** View detailed recipe information including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional facts.
- **Favorites:** Save and manage your favorite recipes for quick access.
- **Shopping List:** Add ingredients to a shopping list for easy grocery shopping.
- **User Authentication:** Register and log in to save recipes and preferences.
- **Responsive Design:** Supports various screen sizes and orientations.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile.
- **Dart:** The programming language for developing the application.
- **Firebase:** For backend services like authentication, database, and storage.
- **Provider:** State management solution in Flutter.
- **API Integration:** Integration with a recipe API for fetching recipe data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or above)
- Android Studio or Xcode (for iOS)
- Firebase account for backend services
- Recipe API key (e.g., from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api))

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-app.git
    cd recipe-app
    ```

2. **Install Flutter SDK:**
    Follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install the Flutter SDK.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Set Up API Key:**
    - Create a file named `api_keys.dart` in the `lib/` directory.
    - Add your recipe API key in the following format:
      ```dart
      const String recipeApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
      ```

5. **Set Up Firebase:**
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - Follow the instructions to add Firebase to your Flutter app. Download `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS.
    - Place these files in the appropriate directories as described in the Firebase setup guide.

6. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

1. **Explore Recipes:**
   Browse recipes by category or use the search bar to find recipes based on ingredients or meal types.

2. **View Recipe Details:**
   Tap on a recipe to view its details, including ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional information.

3. **Save Favorites:**
   Save your favorite recipes by tapping the heart icon for quick access later.

4. **Manage Shopping List:**
   Add recipe ingredients to your shopping list to help with grocery shopping.

5. **Personalize Experience:**

## API Integration

1. **Recipe Data:**
   The app fetches recipe data from a recipe API such as [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). Ensure you have an API key and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual key in the `api_keys.dart` file.

2. **Firebase Integration:**
   The app uses Firebase for user authentication, database storage of favorite recipes, and cloud functions for additional backend logic if necessary.

## Firebase Setup

1. **Authentication:**
   Set up Firebase Authentication to enable email/password sign-in.

2. **Cloud Firestore:**
   Use Firestore for storing user data, favorite recipes, and other application data.

3. **Cloud Storage:**
   Configure Firebase Storage for uploading and storing recipe images if needed.

4. **Cloud Functions:**
   Set up Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side logic if required.
